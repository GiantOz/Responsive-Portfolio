            <p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. That's my family Kay, that's not me. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.</p>

            <p>Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!</p>
